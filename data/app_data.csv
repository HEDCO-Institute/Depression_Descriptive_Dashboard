This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers. Of those identified as being at-risk and invited to attend the ACE program, 82% of females and 76% of males agreed to participate.",Included if they scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18),143,-999,11,14.5,1.

This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers. Of those identified as being at-risk and invited to attend the ACE program, 82% of females and 76% of males agreed to participate.",Included if they scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18),143,-999,11,14.5,1.

December 2012, at school during class-time, using the Reynolds
Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2; Reynolds, 2002). To be
eligible for further participation in the study, girls had to score at or

sample (RADS-2 score  59, n ¼ 297). Exclusion criteria were suicidal
ideation (score 2 on Children’s Depression Inventory item 9,
n ¼ 2) and currently receiving mental health care (n ¼ 26). Girls
indicating suicidal ideation at screening, or any time point within
the study, were contacted along with their parents and were provided
information on possible mental health care services they
could access. Girls were informed of this procedure at the start of
the study. Suicidal ideation (n ¼ 6) during intervention or at followup
was not an exclusion criteria.

The principals of two schools refused participation, expressing concerns for the potential loss of lessons for their normal school curriculum. A written description of the study was sent to the parents of the eighth graders at the four participating schools. Additionally, we described the study in detail to the adolescents and their parents in a parent–teacher conference. In these conferences the adolescents, parents, and their class teachers discussed the participation of the class and decided together if the class as a whole should participate in the study. As result of this procedure, all classes invited to participate in the study decided to give consent. Furthermore, all parents and adolescents not participating in the parent–teacher conferences gave their consent.

Adolescents, parents, and teachers of the intervention and control
groups were informed about the program’s objectives to
strengthen the skills of the adolescents and to facilitate their coping
with strains. It was explained that having a control group is
essential in order to study the program’s effects.",-999,301,12,4,13.7,1. Mean,0.61,1. Standard deviation,8,2. Middle School,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,Germany,64. Non-US Study,4.

teachers discussed the study, in each classroom to recruit student participants. Depending
on school district requirements, passive or active informed consent was used for approval
to collect data on student participants. A recruitment flyer along with the consent form
was given to each student to take home. For passive consent, caregivers of student
participants were given a week to opt their student out of the study. After caregiver
consent was established, students were asked to participate in the study and sign a
consent form (if 18 years or older) or assent form (if under the age of 18). Students were
told they would receive a $10.00 gift card to a local store (e.g., Target, Walmart, Dollar

students must receive special education services including students currently on an

health problems they are considered a selected prevention population. No mental health
diagnostic screening criteria were used as inclusion or exclusion criteria. In addition, data
were not used on students whose disability impacted their ability to comprehend the
curriculum and measures (this was determined by the student’s teacher).""

Four hundred and nineteen Year 10 students (average age 14 years) identifying as Ma - ori and Pacific in eight secondary schools in the North Island of New Zealand were screened for depressive symptoms with the Children’s Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) using a passive consent process. Passive consent meant in this case that parents or caregivers and students were advised about the screening but that no signed consents were necessary from either for the student to take part. The process involved informing the young people of the screening through an assembly and form room talks, and the parents through newsletter articles and letters given to students to take home. Parents or caregivers were given the opportunity to contact the school, the researcher or the supervising university with any questions or concerns, and both caregivers/parents and students were informed of the students’ right to not participate at any point in the study. This method of consent was chosen because there were seen to be logistical problems with administering the questionnaires in schools where some parents had given consent and others had not, and screening of a whole cohort meant that young people who might otherwise be missed and who might be at risk of depression were identified.

the study and set up a booth to inform and recruit participants
during lunch time. Posters were hung on school walls.
School staff were also instructed to encourage participants
to contact the research team if they thought the study could
be relevant for them. Interested participants completed the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)
screener (Radloff, 1977) and, as in the previous efficacy trial
(Stice et al., 2008), those with scores of 20 or above were
invited to participate in a pretest interview with a research

This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers.

All adolescents enrolled in their final year of secondary school in participating schools were invited to participate in the trial. All students at participating partially selective schools were eligible to participate in the trial; however, streaming status (ie, selective or comprehensive) was recorded and evaluated in analyses. Written, informed consent was sought from students and their parents prior to the start of the trial. Students who did not provide consent were able to access the assigned intervention; however, only those with consent completed the research questionnaires.

A total of 23 secondary schools were approached between
August 1 and November 28, 2014, to participate in the trial. Of
14 schools who initially agreed to participate, 4 dropped out
prior to randomization leaving 10 schools contributing 7 to 126

Interventions will be provided during the school day as part of the school PSHE curriculum. All eligible
children, i.e. years 8–11 (12–16 years old) will be expected to participate. There will be some occasions
when young people do not participate in PSHE for religious reasons or due to absence but it is expected
that these will be limited. Attendance at each session during the study will be monitored.

For the control condition, one section (n = 36) of Grade 9 of another branch of the intervention school was screened. 7 met inclusion criteria; 1 student declined to participate without giving any reason. 6 girls were selected in the final sample, all of whom attended the psycho-educatory session","‘At-risk for depression’ was operationalized as having elevated but subclinical symptoms of depression, defined by cut-off scores on Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).",19,2,1,14.4,1.

For the current pilot, for objective 1, a total of 300 students across three schools were screened using CDI and CES-DC and a socio-demographic data sheet which contained items on inclusion and exclusion criteria as well. The three schools were selected randomly from a pool of schools that gave permission to carry out the study. 

For the current study, students of Grade 9 who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria constituted the intervention (n = 13) and the control (n = 6) groups.

Informed consent was obtained from principals and parents and assent from students prior to recruitment. 

For the intervention condition, one section (n = 40) of Grade 9 of a school was screened. 15 girls met inclusion criteria, of which 2 had to be excluded on account of absence due to girls’ scout camp. 

For the control condition, one section (n = 36) of Grade 9 of another branch of the intervention school was screened. 7 met inclusion criteria; 1 student declined to participate without giving any reason. 6 girls were selected in the final sample, all of whom attended the psycho-educatory session","‘At-risk for depression’ was operationalized as having elevated but subclinical symptoms of depression, defined by cut-off scores on Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).",19,2,1,14.4,1.
