This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers. Of those identified as being at-risk and invited to attend the ACE program, 82% of females and 76% of males agreed to participate.",Included if they scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18),143,-999,11,14.5,1.

designed to help their children better handle difficult situations at school and at home. Parents were
also told that the school was supportive of the program and that if they agreed to participate, their
child would be randomly assigned to participate in either a Coping Skills Program or a notreatment
condition. No mention was made of depression prevention in this letter. Parents were
informed that their child would receive a one-time payment of $5 for participating during the first
year, a one-time payment of $10 for the second year, and a one-time payment of $15 for the third
year, irrespective of the condition to which he or she was assigned. This payment was made

This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers. Of those identified as being at-risk and invited to attend the ACE program, 82% of females and 76% of males agreed to participate.",Included if they scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18),143,-999,11,14.5,1.

eligible for further participation in the study, girls had to score at or

sample (RADS-2 score  59, n ¼ 297). Exclusion criteria were suicidal
ideation (score 2 on Children’s Depression Inventory item 9,

indicating suicidal ideation at screening, or any time point within
the study, were contacted along with their parents and were provided
information on possible mental health care services they
could access. Girls were informed of this procedure at the start of

teachers discussed the study, in each classroom to recruit student participants. Depending
on school district requirements, passive or active informed consent was used for approval
to collect data on student participants. A recruitment flyer along with the consent form
was given to each student to take home. For passive consent, caregivers of student
participants were given a week to opt their student out of the study. After caregiver
consent was established, students were asked to participate in the study and sign a
consent form (if 18 years or older) or assent form (if under the age of 18). Students were

students must receive special education services including students currently on an

health problems they are considered a selected prevention population. No mental health
diagnostic screening criteria were used as inclusion or exclusion criteria. In addition, data
were not used on students whose disability impacted their ability to comprehend the
curriculum and measures (this was determined by the student’s teacher).""

Four hundred and nineteen Year 10 students (average age 14 years) identifying as Ma - ori and Pacific in eight secondary schools in the North Island of New Zealand were screened for depressive symptoms with the Children’s Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) using a passive consent process. Passive consent meant in this case that parents or caregivers and students were advised about the screening but that no signed consents were necessary from either for the student to take part. The process involved informing the young people of the screening through an assembly and form room talks, and the parents through newsletter articles and letters given to students to take home. Parents or caregivers were given the opportunity to contact the school, the researcher or the supervising university with any questions or concerns, and both caregivers/parents and students were informed of the students’ right to not participate at any point in the study. This method of consent was chosen because there were seen to be logistical problems with administering the questionnaires in schools where some parents had given consent and others had not, and screening of a whole cohort meant that young people who might otherwise be missed and who might be at risk of depression were identified. Schools were selected from across the socioeconomic range using Ministry of Education decile rankings (Ministry of Education, 1997). Two of the schools were drawn from the Wellington metropolitan area, which statistically is a better-educated and higher-income area than the average sector of New Zealand (Statistics New Zealand, 2003).

Four hundred and nineteen Year 10 students (average age 14 years) identifying as Ma - ori and Pacific in eight secondary schools in the North Island of New Zealand were screened for depressive symptoms with the Children’s Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) using a passive consent process. Passive consent meant in this case that parents or caregivers and students were advised about the screening but that no signed consents were necessary from either for the student to take part. The process involved informing the young people of the screening through an assembly and form room talks, and the parents through newsletter articles and letters given to students to take home. Parents or caregivers were given the opportunity to contact the school, the researcher or the supervising university with any questions or concerns, and both caregivers/parents and students were informed of the students’ right to not participate at any point in the study. This method of consent was chosen because there were seen to be logistical problems with administering the questionnaires in schools where some parents had given consent and others had not, and screening of a whole cohort meant that young people who might otherwise be missed and who might be at risk of depression were identified. Schools were selected from across the socioeconomic range using Ministry of Education decile rankings (Ministry of Education, 1997).

This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals’ and school counsellors’ meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys’ school, one non-selective girls’ school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age group’s ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers.

students must receive special education services including students currently on an

For the intervention condition, one section (n = 40) of Grade 9 of a school was screened. 15 girls met inclusion criteria, of which 2 had to be excluded on account of absence due to girls’ scout camp. 

For the control condition, one section (n = 36) of Grade 9 of another branch of the intervention school was screened. 7 met inclusion criteria; 1 student declined to participate without giving any reason. 6 girls were selected in the final sample, all of whom attended the psycho-educatory session","‘At-risk for depression’ was operationalized as having elevated but subclinical symptoms of depression, defined by cut-off scores on Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).",19,2,1,14.4,1.
